            Container for the parameters to the AcceptMatch operation.
            Registers a player's acceptance or rejection of a proposed FlexMatch match. A matchmaking
            configuration may require player acceptance; if so, then matches built with that configuration
            cannot be completed unless all players accept the proposed match within a specified
            time limit. 
            
             
            <para>
            When FlexMatch builds a match, all the matchmaking tickets involved in the proposed
            match are placed into status <code>REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE</code>. This is a trigger for
            your game to get acceptance from all players in the ticket. Acceptances are only valid
            for tickets when they are in this status; all other acceptances result in an error.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To register acceptance, specify the ticket ID, a response, and one or more players.
            Once all players have registered acceptance, the matchmaking tickets advance to status
            <code>PLACING</code>, where a new game session is created for the match. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If any player rejects the match, or if acceptances are not received before a specified
            timeout, the proposed match is dropped. The matchmaking tickets are then handled in
            one of two ways: For tickets where one or more players rejected the match, the ticket
            status is returned to <code>SEARCHING</code> to find a new match. For tickets where
            one or more players failed to respond, the ticket status is set to <code>CANCELLED</code>,
            and processing is terminated. A new matchmaking request for these players can be submitted
            as needed.

            <para>
            Locates an available game server and temporarily reserves it to host gameplay and
            players. This action is called by a game client or client service (such as a matchmaker)
            to request hosting resources for a new game session. In response, GameLift FleetIQ
            searches for an available game server in the specified game server group, places the
            game server in "claimed" status for 60 seconds, and returns connection information
            back to the requester so that players can connect to the game server. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            There are two ways you can claim a game server. For the first option, you provide
            a game server group ID only, which prompts GameLift FleetIQ to search for an available
            game server in the specified group and claim it. With this option, GameLift FleetIQ
            attempts to consolidate gameplay on as few instances as possible to minimize hosting
            costs. For the second option, you request a specific game server by its ID. This option
            results in a less efficient claiming process because it does not take advantage of
            consolidation and may fail if the requested game server is unavailable. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To claim a game server, identify a game server group and (optionally) a game server
            ID. If your game requires that game data be provided to the game server at the start
            of a game, such as a game map or player information, you can provide it in your claim
            request. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            When a game server is successfully claimed, connection information is returned. A
            claimed game server's utilization status remains AVAILABLE, while the claim status
            is set to CLAIMED for up to 60 seconds. This time period allows the game server to
            be prompted to update its status to UTILIZED (using <a>UpdateGameServer</a>). If the
            game server's status is not updated within 60 seconds, the game server reverts to
            unclaimed status and is available to be claimed by another request.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If you try to claim a specific game server, this request will fail in the following
            cases: (1) if the game server utilization status is UTILIZED, (2) if the game server
            claim status is CLAIMED, or (3) if the instance that the game server is running on
            is flagged as draining.

            Creates an alias for a fleet. In most situations, you can use an alias ID in place
            of a fleet ID. An alias provides a level of abstraction for a fleet that is useful
            when redirecting player traffic from one fleet to another, such as when updating your
            game build. 
            
             
            <para>
            Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and terminal.
            A simple alias points to an active fleet. A terminal alias is used to display messaging
            or link to a URL instead of routing players to an active fleet. For example, you might
            use a terminal alias when a game version is no longer supported and you want to direct
            players to an upgrade site. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional description.
            Each simple alias can point to only one fleet, but a fleet can have multiple aliases.
            If successful, a new alias record is returned, including an alias ID and an ARN. You
            can reassign an alias to another fleet by calling <code>UpdateAlias</code>.

            Creates a new fleet to run your game servers. whether they are custom game builds
            or Realtime Servers with game-specific script. A fleet is a set of Amazon Elastic
            Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, each of which can host multiple game sessions.
            When creating a fleet, you choose the hardware specifications, set some configuration
            options, and specify the game server to deploy on the new fleet. 
            
             
            <para>
            To create a new fleet, provide the following: (1) a fleet name, (2) an EC2 instance
            type and fleet type (spot or on-demand), (3) the build ID for your game build or script
            ID if using Realtime Servers, and (4) a runtime configuration, which determines how
            game servers will run on each instance in the fleet.

            Instructions for launching server processes on each instance in the fleet. Server
            processes run either a custom game build executable or a Realtime script. The runtime

            and the number of processes to run concurrently on each instance. When creating a
            fleet, the runtime configuration must have at least one server process configuration;
            otherwise the request fails with an invalid request exception. (This parameter replaces
            the parameters <code>ServerLaunchPath</code> and <code>ServerLaunchParameters</code>,

            Creates a GameLift FleetIQ game server group to manage a collection of EC2 instances
            for game hosting. In addition to creating the game server group, this action also
            creates an Auto Scaling group in your AWS account and establishes a link between the
            two groups. You have full control over configuration of the Auto Scaling group, but
            GameLift FleetIQ routinely certain Auto Scaling group properties in order to optimize
            the group's instances for low-cost game hosting. You can view the status of your game
            server groups in the GameLift Console. Game server group metrics and events are emitted
            to Amazon CloudWatch.

            <para>
            Prior creating a new game server group, you must set up the following:

             <ul> <li> 
            <para>
            An EC2 launch template. The template provides configuration settings for a set of
            EC2 instances and includes the game server build that you want to deploy and run on
            each instance. For more information on creating a launch template, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html">

             </li> <li>

            <para>
            To create a new game server group, provide a name and specify the IAM role and EC2
            launch template. You also need to provide a list of instance types to be used in the
            group and set initial maximum and minimum limits on the group's instance count. You
            can optionally set an autoscaling policy with target tracking based on a GameLift
            FleetIQ metric.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            Once the game server group and corresponding Auto Scaling group are created, you have
            full access to change the Auto Scaling group's configuration as needed. Keep in mind,
            however, that some properties are periodically updated by GameLift FleetIQ as it balances
            the group's instances based on availability and cost.

            You can set up a queue to try to place game sessions on fleets in multiple Regions.
            To add placement requests to a queue, call <a>StartGameSessionPlacement</a> and reference
            the queue name.
            
             
            <para>
             <b>Destination order.</b> When processing a request for a game session, Amazon GameLift
            tries each destination in order until it finds one with available resources to host
            the new game session. A queue's default order is determined by how destinations are
            listed. The default order is overridden when a game session placement request provides
            player latency information. Player latency information enables Amazon GameLift to
            prioritize destinations where players report the lowest average latency, as a result
            placing the new game session where the majority of players will have the best possible
            gameplay experience.
            </para>
             
            <para>
             <b>Player latency policies.</b> For placement requests containing player latency
            information, use player latency policies to protect individual players from very high
            latencies. With a latency cap, even when a destination can deliver a low latency for
            most players, the game is not placed where any individual player is reporting latency
            higher than a policy's maximum. A queue can have multiple latency policies, which
            are enforced consecutively starting with the policy with the lowest latency cap. Use
            multiple policies to gradually relax latency controls; for example, you might set
            a policy with a low latency cap for the first 60 seconds, a second policy with a higher
            cap for the next 60 seconds, etc. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To create a new queue, provide a name, timeout value, a list of destinations and,
            if desired, a set of latency policies. If successful, a new queue object is returned.

            its duration period. For example, a queue might enforce a 60-second policy followed
            by a 120-second policy, and then no policy for the remainder of the placement. A player
            latency policy must set a value for <code>MaximumIndividualPlayerLatencyMilliseconds</code>.

            Reserves open slots in a game session for a group of players. Before players can be
            added, a game session must have an <code>ACTIVE</code> status, have a creation policy
            of <code>ALLOW_ALL</code>, and have an open player slot. To add a single player to
            a game session, use <a>CreatePlayerSession</a>. When a player connects to the game
            server and references a player session ID, the game server contacts the Amazon GameLift
            service to validate the player reservation and accept the player.
            
             
            <para>
            To create player sessions, specify a game session ID, a list of player IDs, and optionally
            a set of player data strings. If successful, a slot is reserved in the game session
            for each player and a set of new <a>PlayerSession</a> objects is returned. Player
            sessions cannot be updated.

            Creates a new script record for your Realtime Servers script. Realtime scripts are
            JavaScript that provide configuration settings and optional custom game logic for
            your game. The script is deployed when you create a Realtime Servers fleet to host
            your game sessions. Script logic is executed during an active game session.

            To create a new script record, specify a script name and provide the script file(s).
            The script files and all dependencies must be zipped into a single file. You can pull
            the zip file from either of these locations:

            An Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket under your AWS account. Use the
            <i>StorageLocation</i> parameter for this option. You'll need to have an Identity
            Access Management (IAM) role that allows the Amazon GameLift service to access your
            S3 bucket.

            If the call is successful, a new script record is created with a unique script ID.
            If the script file is provided as a local file, the file is uploaded to an Amazon
            GameLift-owned S3 bucket and the script record's storage location reflects this location.
            If the script file is provided as an S3 bucket, Amazon GameLift accesses the file
            at this storage location as needed for deployment.

            Container for the parameters to the CreateVpcPeeringConnection operation.
            Establishes a VPC peering connection between a virtual private cloud (VPC) in an AWS
            account with the VPC for your Amazon GameLift fleet. VPC peering enables the game
            servers on your fleet to communicate directly with other AWS resources. You can peer
            with VPCs in any AWS account that you have access to, including the account that you
            use to manage your Amazon GameLift fleets. You cannot peer with VPCs that are in different
            Regions. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/vpc-peering.html">VPC
            Peering with Amazon GameLift Fleets</a>.
            
             
            <para>
            Before calling this operation to establish the peering connection, you first need
            to call <a>CreateVpcPeeringAuthorization</a> and identify the VPC you want to peer
            with. Once the authorization for the specified VPC is issued, you have 24 hours to
            establish the connection. These two operations handle all tasks necessary to peer
            the two VPCs, including acceptance, updating routing tables, etc. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To establish the connection, call this operation from the AWS account that is used
            to manage the Amazon GameLift fleets. Identify the following values: (1) The ID of
            the fleet you want to be enable a VPC peering connection for; (2) The AWS account
            with the VPC that you want to peer with; and (3) The ID of the VPC you want to peer
            with. This operation is asynchronous. If successful, a <a>VpcPeeringConnection</a>
            request is created. You can use continuous polling to track the request's status using
            <a>DescribeVpcPeeringConnections</a>, or by monitoring fleet events for success or

            Terminates a game server group and permanently deletes the game server group record.
            You have several options for how these resources are impacted when deleting the game
            server group. Depending on the type of delete action selected, this action may affect
            three types of resources: the game server group, the corresponding Auto Scaling group,
            and all game servers currently running in the group. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To delete a game server group, identify the game server group to delete and specify
            the type of delete action to initiate. Game server groups can only be deleted if they
            are in ACTIVE or ERROR status.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If the delete request is successful, a series of actions are kicked off. The game
            server group status is changed to DELETE_SCHEDULED, which prevents new game servers
            from being registered and stops autoscaling activity. Once all game servers in the
            game server group are de-registered, GameLift FleetIQ can begin deleting resources.
            If any of the delete actions fail, the game server group is placed in ERROR status.

            Retrieves properties for one or more player sessions. This action can be used in several
            ways: (1) provide a <code>PlayerSessionId</code> to request properties for a specific
            player session; (2) provide a <code>GameSessionId</code> to request properties for
            all player sessions in the specified game session; (3) provide a <code>PlayerId</code>

            To get game session record(s), specify only one of the following: a player session
            ID, a game session ID, or a player ID. You can filter this request by player session
            status. Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.
            If successful, a <a>PlayerSession</a> object is returned for each session matching
            the request.

            Rules -- Optional. Rules define how to evaluate potential players for a match based
            on player attributes. A rule might specify minimum requirements for individual players,
            teams, or entire matches. For example, a rule might require each player to meet a
            certain skill level, each team to have at least one player in a certain role, or the
            match to have a minimum average skill level. or may describe an entire group--such
            as all teams must be evenly matched or have at least one player in a certain role.

            Expansions -- Optional. Expansions allow you to relax the rules after a period of

            into games in a reasonable amount of time instead of making them wait indefinitely
            for the best possible match. For example, you might use an expansion to increase the
            maximum skill variance between players after 30 seconds.

            Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet. Scaling policies are used to automatically
            scale a fleet's hosting capacity to meet player demand. An active scaling policy instructs
            Amazon GameLift to track a fleet metric and automatically change the fleet's capacity
            when a certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies: target-based
            and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage fleet
            scaling; this option is the most commonly used. Use rule-based policies when you need
            to exert fine-grained control over auto-scaling. 
            
             
            <para>
            Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the same time;
            you can have one target-based policy, one or multiple rule-based scaling policies,
            or both. We recommend caution, however, because multiple auto-scaling policies can
            have unintended consequences.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            You can temporarily suspend all scaling policies for a fleet by calling <a>StopFleetActions</a>
            with the fleet action AUTO_SCALING. To resume scaling policies, call <a>StartFleetActions</a>
            with the same fleet action. To stop just one scaling policy--or to permanently remove
            it, you must delete the policy with <a>DeleteScalingPolicy</a>.

            <para>
            A target-based policy tracks a single metric: PercentAvailableGameSessions. This metric
            tells us how much of a fleet's hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions but
            is not currently in use. This is the fleet's buffer; it measures the additional player
            demand that the fleet could handle at current capacity. With a target-based policy,
            you set your ideal buffer size and leave it to Amazon GameLift to take whatever action
            is needed to maintain that target. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            For example, you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that has the capacity
            to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This policy tells Amazon GameLift to take
            action whenever the fleet's available capacity falls below or rises above 10 game
            sessions. Amazon GameLift will start new instances or stop unused instances in order
            to return to the 10% buffer. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name, and set the
            policy type to "TargetBased". Specify the metric to track (PercentAvailableGameSessions)
            and reference a <a>TargetConfiguration</a> object with your desired buffer value.
            Exclude all other parameters. On a successful request, the policy name is returned.
            The scaling policy is automatically in force as soon as it's successfully created.
            If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will
            be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.

            A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold value, and specifies
            the type of action to initiate when triggered. With a rule-based policy, you can select
            from several available fleet metrics. Each policy specifies whether to scale up or
            scale down (and by how much), so you need one policy for each type of action. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            For example, a policy may make the following statement: "If the percentage of idle
            instances is greater than 20% for more than 15 minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity
            by 10%."
            </para>
             
            <para>
            A policy's rule statement has the following structure:
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If <code>[MetricName]</code> is <code>[ComparisonOperator]</code> <code>[Threshold]</code>
            for <code>[EvaluationPeriods]</code> minutes, then <code>[ScalingAdjustmentType]</code>
            to/by <code>[ScalingAdjustment]</code>.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To implement the example, the rule statement would look like this:
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If <code>[PercentIdleInstances]</code> is <code>[GreaterThanThreshold]</code> <code>[20]</code>
            for <code>[15]</code> minutes, then <code>[PercentChangeInCapacity]</code> to/by <code>[10]</code>.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of name and fleet
            ID, and set the policy type to "RuleBased". Specify the parameter values for a policy
            rule statement. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. Scaling policies
            are automatically in force as soon as they're successfully created. If the fleet's
            auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once
            the fleet actions are restarted.

            A policy that limits the number of game sessions a player can create on the same fleet.
            This optional policy gives game owners control over how players can consume available
            game server resources. A resource creation policy makes the following statement: "An
            individual player can create a maximum number of new game sessions within a specified
            time period".
            
             
            <para>
            The policy is evaluated when a player tries to create a new game session. For example:
            Assume you have a policy of 10 new game sessions and a time period of 60 minutes.
            On receiving a <code>CreateGameSession</code> request, Amazon GameLift checks that
            the player (identified by <code>CreatorId</code>) has created fewer than 10 game sessions
            in the past 60 minutes.

            Retrieves all active game sessions that match a set of search criteria and sorts them
            in a specified order. You can search or sort by the following game session attributes:
            
             <ul> <li> 
            <para>
             <b>gameSessionId</b> -- A unique identifier for the game session. You can use either

             </li> <li> 
            <para>
             <b>gameSessionName</b> -- Name assigned to a game session. This value is set when
            requesting a new game session with <a>CreateGameSession</a> or updating with <a>UpdateGameSession</a>.
            Game session names do not need to be unique to a game session.

            <para>
             <b>gameSessionProperties</b> -- Custom data defined in a game session's <code>GameProperty</code>
            parameter. <code>GameProperty</code> values are stored as key:value pairs; the filter
            expression must indicate the key and a string to search the data values for. For example,
            to search for game sessions with custom data containing the key:value pair "gameMode:brawl",
            specify the following: <code>gameSessionProperties.gameMode = "brawl"</code>. All
            custom data values are searched as strings.

             <b>hasAvailablePlayerSessions</b> -- Boolean value indicating whether a game session
            has reached its maximum number of players. It is highly recommended that all search

            A filter expression can contain one or multiple conditions. Each condition consists
            of the following:

             <ul> <li> 
            <para>
             <b>Operand</b> -- Name of a game session attribute. Valid values are <code>gameSessionName</code>,

             <b>Value</b> -- Value to be searched for. Values may be numbers, boolean values (true/false)
            or strings depending on the operand. String values are case sensitive and must be
            enclosed in single quotes. Special characters must be escaped. Boolean and string
            values can only be used with the comparators <code>=</code> and <code>&lt;&gt;</code>.
            For example, the following filter expression searches on <code>gameSessionName</code>:

            <para>
            To chain multiple conditions in a single expression, use the logical keywords <code>AND</code>,

            Places a request for a new game session in a queue (see <a>CreateGameSessionQueue</a>).
            When processing a placement request, Amazon GameLift searches for available resources
            on the queue's destinations, scanning each until it finds resources or the placement
            request times out.
            
             
            <para>
            A game session placement request can also request player sessions. When a new game
            session is successfully created, Amazon GameLift creates a player session for each
            player included in the request.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            When placing a game session, by default Amazon GameLift tries each fleet in the order
            they are listed in the queue configuration. Ideally, a queue's destinations are listed
            in preference order.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            Alternatively, when requesting a game session with players, you can also provide latency
            data for each player in relevant Regions. Latency data indicates the performance lag
            a player experiences when connected to a fleet in the Region. Amazon GameLift uses
            latency data to reorder the list of destinations to place the game session in a Region
            with minimal lag. If latency data is provided for multiple players, Amazon GameLift
            calculates each Region's average lag for all players and reorders to get the best
            game play across all players.

            Finds new players to fill open slots in an existing game session. This operation can
            be used to add players to matched games that start with fewer than the maximum number
            of players or to replace players when they drop out. By backfilling with the same
            matchmaker used to create the original match, you ensure that new players meet the
            match criteria and maintain a consistent experience throughout the game session. You
            can backfill a match anytime after a game session has been created. 
            
             
            <para>
            To request a match backfill, specify a unique ticket ID, the existing game session's
            ARN, a matchmaking configuration, and a set of data that describes all current players
            in the game session. If successful, a match backfill ticket is created and returned
            with status set to QUEUED. The ticket is placed in the matchmaker's ticket pool and
            processed. Track the status of the ticket to respond as needed. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            The process of finding backfill matches is essentially identical to the initial matchmaking
            process. The matchmaker searches the pool and groups tickets together to form potential
            matches, allowing only one backfill ticket per potential match. Once the a match is
            formed, the matchmaker creates player sessions for the new players. All tickets in
            the match are updated with the game session's connection information, and the <a>GameSession</a>
            object is updated to include matchmaker data on the new players. For more detail on
            how match backfill requests are processed, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-match.html">

            rules, and starts a new game for the matched players. Each matchmaking request specifies
            the type of match to build (team configuration, rules for an acceptable match, etc.).
            The request also specifies the players to find a match for and where to host the new
            game session for optimal performance. A matchmaking request might start with a single
            player or a group of players who want to play together. FlexMatch finds additional
            players as needed to fill the match. Match type, rules, and the queue used to place
            a new game session are defined in a <code>MatchmakingConfiguration</code>. 
            
             
            <para>
            To start matchmaking, provide a unique ticket ID, specify a matchmaking configuration,
            and include the players to be matched. You must also include a set of player attributes
            relevant for the matchmaking configuration. If successful, a matchmaking ticket is
            returned with status set to <code>QUEUED</code>. Track the status of the ticket to
            respond as needed and acquire game session connection information for successfully
            completed matches.

            ticket object, including current status and (for completed tickets) game session connection
            info. We recommend polling no more than once every 10 seconds.

            Notifications -- Get event notifications for changes in ticket status using Amazon
            Simple Notification Service (SNS). Notifications are easy to set up (see <a>CreateMatchmakingConfiguration</a>)
            and typically deliver match status changes faster and more efficiently than polling.
            We recommend that you use polling to back up to notifications (since delivery is not
            guaranteed) and call <code>DescribeMatchmaking</code> only when notifications are
            not received within 30 seconds.

            FlexMatch uses this ticket and others in process to build an acceptable match. When
            a potential match is identified, all tickets in the proposed match are advanced to
            the next status. 
            </para>
             </li> <li> 
            <para>
            If the match requires player acceptance (set in the matchmaking configuration), the
            tickets move into status <code>REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE</code>. This status triggers your
            client code to solicit acceptance from all players in every ticket involved in the
            match, and then call <a>AcceptMatch</a> for each player. If any player rejects or
            fails to accept the match before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped
            (see <code>AcceptMatch</code> for more details).

            FlexMatch locates resources for a new game session using the game session queue (set

            Updates capacity settings for a fleet. Use this action to specify the number of EC2
            instances (hosts) that you want this fleet to contain. Before calling this action,
            you may want to call <a>DescribeEC2InstanceLimits</a> to get the maximum capacity

            Specify minimum and maximum number of instances. Amazon GameLift will not change fleet
            capacity to values fall outside of this range. This is particularly important when
            using auto-scaling (see <a>PutScalingPolicy</a>) to allow capacity to adjust based

            To update fleet capacity, specify the fleet ID and the number of instances you want
            the fleet to host. If successful, Amazon GameLift starts or terminates instances so
            that the fleet's active instance count matches the desired instance count. You can
            view a fleet's current capacity information by calling <a>DescribeFleetCapacity</a>.
            If the desired instance count is higher than the instance type's limit, the "Limit
            Exceeded" exception occurs.

            <para>
            Updates information about a registered game server. This action is called by a game
            server process that is running on an instance in a game server group. There are three
            reasons to update game server information: (1) to change the utilization status of
            the game server, (2) to report game server health status, and (3) to change game server
            metadata. A registered game server should regularly report health and should update
            utilization status when it is supporting gameplay so that GameLift FleetIQ can accurately
            track game server availability. You can make all three types of updates in the same
            request.
            </para>
             <ul> <li> 
            <para>
            To update the game server's utilization status, identify the game server and game
            server group and specify the current utilization status. Use this status to identify
            when game servers are currently hosting games and when they are available to be claimed.
            
            </para>
             </li> <li> 
            <para>
            To report health status, identify the game server and game server group and set health
            check to HEALTHY. If a game server does not report health status for a certain length
            of time, the game server is no longer considered healthy and will be eventually de-registered
            from the game server group to avoid affecting utilization metrics. The best practice
            is to report health every 60 seconds.

            Instructions for launching server processes on each instance in the fleet. Server
            processes run either a custom game build executable or a Realtime Servers script.
            The runtime configuration lists the types of server processes to run on an instance
            and includes the following configuration settings: the server executable or launch
            script file, launch parameters, and the number of processes to run concurrently on
            each instance. A CreateFleet request must include a runtime configuration with at

            <para>
            Locates an available game server and temporarily reserves it to host gameplay and
            players. This action is called by a game client or client service (such as a matchmaker)
            to request hosting resources for a new game session. In response, GameLift FleetIQ
            searches for an available game server in the specified game server group, places the
            game server in "claimed" status for 60 seconds, and returns connection information
            back to the requester so that players can connect to the game server. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            There are two ways you can claim a game server. For the first option, you provide
            a game server group ID only, which prompts GameLift FleetIQ to search for an available
            game server in the specified group and claim it. With this option, GameLift FleetIQ
            attempts to consolidate gameplay on as few instances as possible to minimize hosting
            costs. For the second option, you request a specific game server by its ID. This option
            results in a less efficient claiming process because it does not take advantage of
            consolidation and may fail if the requested game server is unavailable. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To claim a game server, identify a game server group and (optionally) a game server
            ID. If your game requires that game data be provided to the game server at the start
            of a game, such as a game map or player information, you can provide it in your claim
            request. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            When a game server is successfully claimed, connection information is returned. A
            claimed game server's utilization status remains AVAILABLE, while the claim status
            is set to CLAIMED for up to 60 seconds. This time period allows the game server to
            be prompted to update its status to UTILIZED (using <a>UpdateGameServer</a>). If the
            game server's status is not updated within 60 seconds, the game server reverts to
            unclaimed status and is available to be claimed by another request.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If you try to claim a specific game server, this request will fail in the following
            cases: (1) if the game server utilization status is UTILIZED, (2) if the game server
            claim status is CLAIMED, or (3) if the instance that the game server is running on
            is flagged as draining.

            Creates a new fleet to run your game servers. whether they are custom game builds
            or Realtime Servers with game-specific script. A fleet is a set of Amazon Elastic
            Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, each of which can host multiple game sessions.
            When creating a fleet, you choose the hardware specifications, set some configuration
            options, and specify the game server to deploy on the new fleet.

            To create a new fleet, provide the following: (1) a fleet name, (2) an EC2 instance
            type and fleet type (spot or on-demand), (3) the build ID for your game build or script
            ID if using Realtime Servers, and (4) a runtime configuration, which determines how
            game servers will run on each instance in the fleet.

            <summary>
            Establishes a new queue for processing requests to place new game sessions. A queue
            identifies where new game sessions can be hosted -- by specifying a list of destinations
            (fleets or aliases) -- and how long requests can wait in the queue before timing out.
            You can set up a queue to try to place game sessions on fleets in multiple Regions.
            To add placement requests to a queue, call <a>StartGameSessionPlacement</a> and reference
            the queue name.
            
             
            <para>
             <b>Destination order.</b> When processing a request for a game session, Amazon GameLift
            tries each destination in order until it finds one with available resources to host
            the new game session. A queue's default order is determined by how destinations are
            listed. The default order is overridden when a game session placement request provides
            player latency information. Player latency information enables Amazon GameLift to
            prioritize destinations where players report the lowest average latency, as a result
            placing the new game session where the majority of players will have the best possible
            gameplay experience.
            </para>
             
            <para>
             <b>Player latency policies.</b> For placement requests containing player latency
            information, use player latency policies to protect individual players from very high
            latencies. With a latency cap, even when a destination can deliver a low latency for
            most players, the game is not placed where any individual player is reporting latency
            higher than a policy's maximum. A queue can have multiple latency policies, which
            are enforced consecutively starting with the policy with the lowest latency cap. Use
            multiple policies to gradually relax latency controls; for example, you might set
            a policy with a low latency cap for the first 60 seconds, a second policy with a higher
            cap for the next 60 seconds, etc. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To create a new queue, provide a name, timeout value, a list of destinations and,
            if desired, a set of latency policies. If successful, a new queue object is returned.

            <summary>
            Establishes a new queue for processing requests to place new game sessions. A queue
            identifies where new game sessions can be hosted -- by specifying a list of destinations
            (fleets or aliases) -- and how long requests can wait in the queue before timing out.
            You can set up a queue to try to place game sessions on fleets in multiple Regions.
            To add placement requests to a queue, call <a>StartGameSessionPlacement</a> and reference
            the queue name.
            
             
            <para>
             <b>Destination order.</b> When processing a request for a game session, Amazon GameLift
            tries each destination in order until it finds one with available resources to host
            the new game session. A queue's default order is determined by how destinations are
            listed. The default order is overridden when a game session placement request provides
            player latency information. Player latency information enables Amazon GameLift to
            prioritize destinations where players report the lowest average latency, as a result
            placing the new game session where the majority of players will have the best possible
            gameplay experience.
            </para>
             
            <para>
             <b>Player latency policies.</b> For placement requests containing player latency
            information, use player latency policies to protect individual players from very high
            latencies. With a latency cap, even when a destination can deliver a low latency for
            most players, the game is not placed where any individual player is reporting latency
            higher than a policy's maximum. A queue can have multiple latency policies, which
            are enforced consecutively starting with the policy with the lowest latency cap. Use
            multiple policies to gradually relax latency controls; for example, you might set
            a policy with a low latency cap for the first 60 seconds, a second policy with a higher
            cap for the next 60 seconds, etc. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To create a new queue, provide a name, timeout value, a list of destinations and,
            if desired, a set of latency policies. If successful, a new queue object is returned.

            Requests remote access to a fleet instance. Remote access is useful for debugging,
            gathering benchmarking data, or observing activity in real time. 
            
             
            <para>
            To remotely access an instance, you need credentials that match the operating system
            of the instance. For a Windows instance, Amazon GameLift returns a user name and password
            as strings for use with a Windows Remote Desktop client. For a Linux instance, Amazon
            GameLift returns a user name and RSA private key, also as strings, for use with an
            SSH client. The private key must be saved in the proper format to a <code>.pem</code>
            file before using. If you're making this request using the AWS CLI, saving the secret
            can be handled as part of the GetInstanceAccess request, as shown in one of the examples
            for this action.

            If successful, an <a>InstanceAccess</a> object is returned that contains the instance's

            Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet. Scaling policies are used to automatically
            scale a fleet's hosting capacity to meet player demand. An active scaling policy instructs
            Amazon GameLift to track a fleet metric and automatically change the fleet's capacity
            when a certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies: target-based
            and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage fleet
            scaling; this option is the most commonly used. Use rule-based policies when you need
            to exert fine-grained control over auto-scaling. 
            
             
            <para>
            Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the same time;
            you can have one target-based policy, one or multiple rule-based scaling policies,
            or both. We recommend caution, however, because multiple auto-scaling policies can
            have unintended consequences.

            <para>
            You can temporarily suspend all scaling policies for a fleet by calling <a>StopFleetActions</a>
            with the fleet action AUTO_SCALING. To resume scaling policies, call <a>StartFleetActions</a>
            with the same fleet action. To stop just one scaling policy--or to permanently remove
            it, you must delete the policy with <a>DeleteScalingPolicy</a>.

            <para>
            A target-based policy tracks a single metric: PercentAvailableGameSessions. This metric
            tells us how much of a fleet's hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions but
            is not currently in use. This is the fleet's buffer; it measures the additional player
            demand that the fleet could handle at current capacity. With a target-based policy,
            you set your ideal buffer size and leave it to Amazon GameLift to take whatever action
            is needed to maintain that target. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            For example, you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that has the capacity
            to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This policy tells Amazon GameLift to take
            action whenever the fleet's available capacity falls below or rises above 10 game
            sessions. Amazon GameLift will start new instances or stop unused instances in order
            to return to the 10% buffer. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name, and set the
            policy type to "TargetBased". Specify the metric to track (PercentAvailableGameSessions)
            and reference a <a>TargetConfiguration</a> object with your desired buffer value.
            Exclude all other parameters. On a successful request, the policy name is returned.
            The scaling policy is automatically in force as soon as it's successfully created.
            If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will
            be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.

            <para>
            A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold value, and specifies
            the type of action to initiate when triggered. With a rule-based policy, you can select
            from several available fleet metrics. Each policy specifies whether to scale up or
            scale down (and by how much), so you need one policy for each type of action. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            For example, a policy may make the following statement: "If the percentage of idle
            instances is greater than 20% for more than 15 minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity
            by 10%."
            </para>
             
            <para>
            A policy's rule statement has the following structure:

            <para>
            If <code>[MetricName]</code> is <code>[ComparisonOperator]</code> <code>[Threshold]</code>

            </para>
             
            <para>
            To implement the example, the rule statement would look like this:

            If <code>[PercentIdleInstances]</code> is <code>[GreaterThanThreshold]</code> <code>[20]</code>

            </para>
             
            <para>
            To create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of name and fleet
            ID, and set the policy type to "RuleBased". Specify the parameter values for a policy
            rule statement. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. Scaling policies
            are automatically in force as soon as they're successfully created. If the fleet's

            Places a request for a new game session in a queue (see <a>CreateGameSessionQueue</a>).
            When processing a placement request, Amazon GameLift searches for available resources
            on the queue's destinations, scanning each until it finds resources or the placement
            request times out.
            
             
            <para>
            A game session placement request can also request player sessions. When a new game
            session is successfully created, Amazon GameLift creates a player session for each
            player included in the request.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            When placing a game session, by default Amazon GameLift tries each fleet in the order
            they are listed in the queue configuration. Ideally, a queue's destinations are listed
            in preference order.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            Alternatively, when requesting a game session with players, you can also provide latency
            data for each player in relevant Regions. Latency data indicates the performance lag
            a player experiences when connected to a fleet in the Region. Amazon GameLift uses
            latency data to reorder the list of destinations to place the game session in a Region
            with minimal lag. If latency data is provided for multiple players, Amazon GameLift
            calculates each Region's average lag for all players and reorders to get the best
            game play across all players.

            on the queue's destinations, scanning each until it finds resources or the placement
            request times out.
            
             
            <para>
            A game session placement request can also request player sessions. When a new game
            session is successfully created, Amazon GameLift creates a player session for each
            player included in the request.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            When placing a game session, by default Amazon GameLift tries each fleet in the order
            they are listed in the queue configuration. Ideally, a queue's destinations are listed
            in preference order.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            Alternatively, when requesting a game session with players, you can also provide latency
            data for each player in relevant Regions. Latency data indicates the performance lag
            a player experiences when connected to a fleet in the Region. Amazon GameLift uses
            latency data to reorder the list of destinations to place the game session in a Region
            with minimal lag. If latency data is provided for multiple players, Amazon GameLift
            calculates each Region's average lag for all players and reorders to get the best
            game play across all players.

            be used to add players to matched games that start with fewer than the maximum number
            of players or to replace players when they drop out. By backfilling with the same
            matchmaker used to create the original match, you ensure that new players meet the
            match criteria and maintain a consistent experience throughout the game session. You
            can backfill a match anytime after a game session has been created. 
            
             
            <para>
            To request a match backfill, specify a unique ticket ID, the existing game session's
            ARN, a matchmaking configuration, and a set of data that describes all current players
            in the game session. If successful, a match backfill ticket is created and returned

            formed, the matchmaker creates player sessions for the new players. All tickets in
            the match are updated with the game session's connection information, and the <a>GameSession</a>

            Uses FlexMatch to create a game match for a group of players based on custom matchmaking
            rules, and starts a new game for the matched players. Each matchmaking request specifies
            the type of match to build (team configuration, rules for an acceptable match, etc.).
            The request also specifies the players to find a match for and where to host the new
            game session for optimal performance. A matchmaking request might start with a single
            player or a group of players who want to play together. FlexMatch finds additional
            players as needed to fill the match. Match type, rules, and the queue used to place
            a new game session are defined in a <code>MatchmakingConfiguration</code>. 
            
             
            <para>
            To start matchmaking, provide a unique ticket ID, specify a matchmaking configuration,
            and include the players to be matched. You must also include a set of player attributes
            relevant for the matchmaking configuration. If successful, a matchmaking ticket is
            returned with status set to <code>QUEUED</code>. Track the status of the ticket to
            respond as needed and acquire game session connection information for successfully
            completed matches.

            Uses FlexMatch to create a game match for a group of players based on custom matchmaking
            rules, and starts a new game for the matched players. Each matchmaking request specifies
            the type of match to build (team configuration, rules for an acceptable match, etc.).
            The request also specifies the players to find a match for and where to host the new
            game session for optimal performance. A matchmaking request might start with a single
            player or a group of players who want to play together. FlexMatch finds additional
            players as needed to fill the match. Match type, rules, and the queue used to place
            a new game session are defined in a <code>MatchmakingConfiguration</code>. 
            
             
            <para>
            To start matchmaking, provide a unique ticket ID, specify a matchmaking configuration,
            and include the players to be matched. You must also include a set of player attributes
            relevant for the matchmaking configuration. If successful, a matchmaking ticket is
            returned with status set to <code>QUEUED</code>. Track the status of the ticket to
            respond as needed and acquire game session connection information for successfully
            completed matches.

            and typically deliver match status changes faster and more efficiently than polling.
            We recommend that you use polling to back up to notifications (since delivery is not
            guaranteed) and call <code>DescribeMatchmaking</code> only when notifications are
            not received within 30 seconds.

            Updates the current runtime configuration for the specified fleet, which tells Amazon
            GameLift how to launch server processes on instances in the fleet. You can update
            a fleet's runtime configuration at any time after the fleet is created; it does not
            need to be in an <code>ACTIVE</code> status.

            To update runtime configuration, specify the fleet ID and provide a <code>RuntimeConfiguration</code>

            Each instance in a Amazon GameLift fleet checks regularly for an updated runtime configuration
            and changes how it launches server processes to comply with the latest version. Existing
            server processes are not affected by the update; runtime configuration changes are
            applied gradually as existing processes shut down and new processes are launched during
            Amazon GameLift's normal process recycling activity.

            <para>
            Locates an available game server and temporarily reserves it to host gameplay and
            players. This action is called by a game client or client service (such as a matchmaker)
            to request hosting resources for a new game session. In response, GameLift FleetIQ
            searches for an available game server in the specified game server group, places the
            game server in "claimed" status for 60 seconds, and returns connection information
            back to the requester so that players can connect to the game server. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            There are two ways you can claim a game server. For the first option, you provide
            a game server group ID only, which prompts GameLift FleetIQ to search for an available
            game server in the specified group and claim it. With this option, GameLift FleetIQ
            attempts to consolidate gameplay on as few instances as possible to minimize hosting
            costs. For the second option, you request a specific game server by its ID. This option
            results in a less efficient claiming process because it does not take advantage of
            consolidation and may fail if the requested game server is unavailable. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To claim a game server, identify a game server group and (optionally) a game server
            ID. If your game requires that game data be provided to the game server at the start
            of a game, such as a game map or player information, you can provide it in your claim
            request. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            When a game server is successfully claimed, connection information is returned. A
            claimed game server's utilization status remains AVAILABLE, while the claim status
            is set to CLAIMED for up to 60 seconds. This time period allows the game server to
            be prompted to update its status to UTILIZED (using <a>UpdateGameServer</a>). If the
            game server's status is not updated within 60 seconds, the game server reverts to
            unclaimed status and is available to be claimed by another request.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If you try to claim a specific game server, this request will fail in the following
            cases: (1) if the game server utilization status is UTILIZED, (2) if the game server
            claim status is CLAIMED, or (3) if the instance that the game server is running on
            is flagged as draining.

            <b>This action is part of Amazon GameLift FleetIQ with game server groups, which
            is in preview release and is subject to change.</b> 
            
             
            <para>
            Locates an available game server and temporarily reserves it to host gameplay and
            players. This action is called by a game client or client service (such as a matchmaker)
            to request hosting resources for a new game session. In response, GameLift FleetIQ
            searches for an available game server in the specified game server group, places the
            game server in "claimed" status for 60 seconds, and returns connection information
            back to the requester so that players can connect to the game server. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            There are two ways you can claim a game server. For the first option, you provide
            a game server group ID only, which prompts GameLift FleetIQ to search for an available
            game server in the specified group and claim it. With this option, GameLift FleetIQ
            attempts to consolidate gameplay on as few instances as possible to minimize hosting
            costs. For the second option, you request a specific game server by its ID. This option
            results in a less efficient claiming process because it does not take advantage of
            consolidation and may fail if the requested game server is unavailable. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To claim a game server, identify a game server group and (optionally) a game server
            ID. If your game requires that game data be provided to the game server at the start
            of a game, such as a game map or player information, you can provide it in your claim
            request. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            When a game server is successfully claimed, connection information is returned. A
            claimed game server's utilization status remains AVAILABLE, while the claim status
            is set to CLAIMED for up to 60 seconds. This time period allows the game server to
            be prompted to update its status to UTILIZED (using <a>UpdateGameServer</a>). If the
            game server's status is not updated within 60 seconds, the game server reverts to
            unclaimed status and is available to be claimed by another request.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If you try to claim a specific game server, this request will fail in the following
            cases: (1) if the game server utilization status is UTILIZED, (2) if the game server
            claim status is CLAIMED, or (3) if the instance that the game server is running on
            is flagged as draining.

            Creates an alias for a fleet. In most situations, you can use an alias ID in place

            A simple alias points to an active fleet. A terminal alias is used to display messaging
            or link to a URL instead of routing players to an active fleet. For example, you might
            use a terminal alias when a game version is no longer supported and you want to direct

            most players, the game is not placed where any individual player is reporting latency
            higher than a policy's maximum. A queue can have multiple latency policies, which

            multiple policies to gradually relax latency controls; for example, you might set
            a policy with a low latency cap for the first 60 seconds, a second policy with a higher
            cap for the next 60 seconds, etc.

            <para>
             <b>Player latency policies.</b> For placement requests containing player latency
            information, use player latency policies to protect individual players from very high
            latencies. With a latency cap, even when a destination can deliver a low latency for
            most players, the game is not placed where any individual player is reporting latency
            higher than a policy's maximum. A queue can have multiple latency policies, which
            are enforced consecutively starting with the policy with the lowest latency cap. Use
            multiple policies to gradually relax latency controls; for example, you might set
            a policy with a low latency cap for the first 60 seconds, a second policy with a higher
            cap for the next 60 seconds, etc. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To create a new queue, provide a name, timeout value, a list of destinations and,
            if desired, a set of latency policies. If successful, a new queue object is returned.

            Defines a new matchmaking configuration for use with FlexMatch. A matchmaking configuration
            sets out guidelines for matching players and getting the matches into games. You can
            set up multiple matchmaking configurations to handle the scenarios needed for your
            game. Each matchmaking ticket (<a>StartMatchmaking</a> or <a>StartMatchBackfill</a>)
            specifies a configuration for the match and provides player attributes to support
            the configuration being used. 
            
             
            <para>
            To create a matchmaking configuration, at a minimum you must specify the following:
            configuration name; a rule set that governs how to evaluate players and find acceptable
            matches; a game session queue to use when placing a new game session for the match;
            and the maximum time allowed for a matchmaking attempt.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            There are two ways to track the progress of matchmaking tickets: (1) polling ticket
            status with <a>DescribeMatchmaking</a>; or (2) receiving notifications with Amazon
            Simple Notification Service (SNS). To use notifications, you first need to set up
            an SNS topic to receive the notifications, and provide the topic ARN in the matchmaking
            configuration. Since notifications promise only "best effort" delivery, we recommend
            calling <code>DescribeMatchmaking</code> if no notifications are received within 30
            seconds.

            Creates a new rule set for FlexMatch matchmaking. A rule set describes the type of
            match to create, such as the number and size of teams. It also sets the parameters
            for acceptable player matches, such as minimum skill level or character type. A rule

            <para>
            To create a matchmaking rule set, provide unique rule set name and the rule set body
            in JSON format. Rule sets must be defined in the same Region as the matchmaking configuration
            they are used with.

            <para>
            Since matchmaking rule sets cannot be edited, it is a good idea to check the rule
            set syntax using <a>ValidateMatchmakingRuleSet</a> before creating a new rule set.

            Requests authorization to create or delete a peer connection between the VPC for your
            Amazon GameLift fleet and a virtual private cloud (VPC) in your AWS account. VPC peering
            enables the game servers on your fleet to communicate directly with other AWS resources.

            Requests remote access to a fleet instance. Remote access is useful for debugging,
            gathering benchmarking data, or observing activity in real time. 
            
             
            <para>
            To remotely access an instance, you need credentials that match the operating system
            of the instance. For a Windows instance, Amazon GameLift returns a user name and password
            as strings for use with a Windows Remote Desktop client. For a Linux instance, Amazon
            GameLift returns a user name and RSA private key, also as strings, for use with an
            SSH client. The private key must be saved in the proper format to a <code>.pem</code>
            file before using. If you're making this request using the AWS CLI, saving the secret
            can be handled as part of the GetInstanceAccess request, as shown in one of the examples
            for this action.

            <para>
            To request access to a specific instance, specify the IDs of both the instance and
            the fleet it belongs to. You can retrieve a fleet's instance IDs by calling <a>DescribeInstances</a>.
            If successful, an <a>InstanceAccess</a> object is returned that contains the instance's
            IP address and a set of credentials.

            Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet. Scaling policies are used to automatically
            scale a fleet's hosting capacity to meet player demand. An active scaling policy instructs
            Amazon GameLift to track a fleet metric and automatically change the fleet's capacity
            when a certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies: target-based
            and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage fleet
            scaling; this option is the most commonly used. Use rule-based policies when you need
            to exert fine-grained control over auto-scaling. 
            
             
            <para>
            Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the same time;
            you can have one target-based policy, one or multiple rule-based scaling policies,
            or both. We recommend caution, however, because multiple auto-scaling policies can
            have unintended consequences.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            You can temporarily suspend all scaling policies for a fleet by calling <a>StopFleetActions</a>
            with the fleet action AUTO_SCALING. To resume scaling policies, call <a>StartFleetActions</a>
            with the same fleet action. To stop just one scaling policy--or to permanently remove
            it, you must delete the policy with <a>DeleteScalingPolicy</a>.

            <para>
            A target-based policy tracks a single metric: PercentAvailableGameSessions. This metric
            tells us how much of a fleet's hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions but
            is not currently in use. This is the fleet's buffer; it measures the additional player
            demand that the fleet could handle at current capacity. With a target-based policy,
            you set your ideal buffer size and leave it to Amazon GameLift to take whatever action
            is needed to maintain that target. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            For example, you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that has the capacity
            to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This policy tells Amazon GameLift to take
            action whenever the fleet's available capacity falls below or rises above 10 game
            sessions. Amazon GameLift will start new instances or stop unused instances in order
            to return to the 10% buffer. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name, and set the
            policy type to "TargetBased". Specify the metric to track (PercentAvailableGameSessions)
            and reference a <a>TargetConfiguration</a> object with your desired buffer value.
            Exclude all other parameters. On a successful request, the policy name is returned.
            The scaling policy is automatically in force as soon as it's successfully created.
            If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will
            be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.
            </para>
             
            <para>
             <b>Rule-based policy</b> 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold value, and specifies
            the type of action to initiate when triggered. With a rule-based policy, you can select
            from several available fleet metrics. Each policy specifies whether to scale up or
            scale down (and by how much), so you need one policy for each type of action. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            For example, a policy may make the following statement: "If the percentage of idle
            instances is greater than 20% for more than 15 minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity
            by 10%."
            </para>
             
            <para>
            A policy's rule statement has the following structure:
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If <code>[MetricName]</code> is <code>[ComparisonOperator]</code> <code>[Threshold]</code>
            for <code>[EvaluationPeriods]</code> minutes, then <code>[ScalingAdjustmentType]</code>
            to/by <code>[ScalingAdjustment]</code>.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To implement the example, the rule statement would look like this:
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If <code>[PercentIdleInstances]</code> is <code>[GreaterThanThreshold]</code> <code>[20]</code>
            for <code>[15]</code> minutes, then <code>[PercentChangeInCapacity]</code> to/by <code>[10]</code>.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of name and fleet
            ID, and set the policy type to "RuleBased". Specify the parameter values for a policy
            rule statement. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. Scaling policies
            are automatically in force as soon as they're successfully created. If the fleet's
            auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once
            the fleet actions are restarted.

            Places a request for a new game session in a queue (see <a>CreateGameSessionQueue</a>).
            When processing a placement request, Amazon GameLift searches for available resources
            on the queue's destinations, scanning each until it finds resources or the placement
            request times out.

            A game session placement request can also request player sessions. When a new game
            session is successfully created, Amazon GameLift creates a player session for each

            </para>
             
            <para>
            When placing a game session, by default Amazon GameLift tries each fleet in the order

            <para>
            Alternatively, when requesting a game session with players, you can also provide latency
            data for each player in relevant Regions. Latency data indicates the performance lag
            a player experiences when connected to a fleet in the Region. Amazon GameLift uses
            latency data to reorder the list of destinations to place the game session in a Region
            with minimal lag. If latency data is provided for multiple players, Amazon GameLift
            calculates each Region's average lag for all players and reorders to get the best
            game play across all players.

            <summary>
            Uses FlexMatch to create a game match for a group of players based on custom matchmaking
            rules, and starts a new game for the matched players. Each matchmaking request specifies
            the type of match to build (team configuration, rules for an acceptable match, etc.).
            The request also specifies the players to find a match for and where to host the new
            game session for optimal performance. A matchmaking request might start with a single
            player or a group of players who want to play together. FlexMatch finds additional
            players as needed to fill the match. Match type, rules, and the queue used to place
            a new game session are defined in a <code>MatchmakingConfiguration</code>. 
            
             
            <para>
            To start matchmaking, provide a unique ticket ID, specify a matchmaking configuration,
            and include the players to be matched. You must also include a set of player attributes
            relevant for the matchmaking configuration. If successful, a matchmaking ticket is
            returned with status set to <code>QUEUED</code>. Track the status of the ticket to
            respond as needed and acquire game session connection information for successfully
            completed matches.

            and typically deliver match status changes faster and more efficiently than polling.
            We recommend that you use polling to back up to notifications (since delivery is not
            guaranteed) and call <code>DescribeMatchmaking</code> only when notifications are
            not received within 30 seconds.

            <para>
            Your client code submits a <code>StartMatchmaking</code> request for one or more players

            <para>
            FlexMatch uses this ticket and others in process to build an acceptable match. When
            a potential match is identified, all tickets in the proposed match are advanced to
            the next status. 
            </para>
             </li> <li> 
            <para>
            If the match requires player acceptance (set in the matchmaking configuration), the
            tickets move into status <code>REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE</code>. This status triggers your
            client code to solicit acceptance from all players in every ticket involved in the
            match, and then call <a>AcceptMatch</a> for each player. If any player rejects or
            fails to accept the match before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped
            (see <code>AcceptMatch</code> for more details).

            <para>
            Once a match is proposed and accepted, the matchmaking tickets move into status <code>PLACING</code>.
            FlexMatch locates resources for a new game session using the game session queue (set
            in the matchmaking configuration) and creates the game session based on the match

            <summary>
            Uses FlexMatch to create a game match for a group of players based on custom matchmaking
            rules, and starts a new game for the matched players. Each matchmaking request specifies
            the type of match to build (team configuration, rules for an acceptable match, etc.).
            The request also specifies the players to find a match for and where to host the new
            game session for optimal performance. A matchmaking request might start with a single
            player or a group of players who want to play together. FlexMatch finds additional
            players as needed to fill the match. Match type, rules, and the queue used to place
            a new game session are defined in a <code>MatchmakingConfiguration</code>. 
            
             
            <para>
            To start matchmaking, provide a unique ticket ID, specify a matchmaking configuration,
            and include the players to be matched. You must also include a set of player attributes
            relevant for the matchmaking configuration. If successful, a matchmaking ticket is
            returned with status set to <code>QUEUED</code>. Track the status of the ticket to
            respond as needed and acquire game session connection information for successfully
            completed matches.
            </para>
             
            <para>
             <b>Tracking ticket status</b> -- A couple of options are available for tracking the

             <ul> <li> 
            <para>
            Polling -- Call <code>DescribeMatchmaking</code>. This operation returns the full
            ticket object, including current status and (for completed tickets) game session connection
            info. We recommend polling no more than once every 10 seconds.

            Notifications -- Get event notifications for changes in ticket status using Amazon
            Simple Notification Service (SNS). Notifications are easy to set up (see <a>CreateMatchmakingConfiguration</a>)
            and typically deliver match status changes faster and more efficiently than polling.
            We recommend that you use polling to back up to notifications (since delivery is not
            guaranteed) and call <code>DescribeMatchmaking</code> only when notifications are
            not received within 30 seconds.
            </para>

             <ol> <li> 
            <para>
            Your client code submits a <code>StartMatchmaking</code> request for one or more players
            and tracks the status of the request ticket. 
            </para>
             </li> <li> 
            <para>
            FlexMatch uses this ticket and others in process to build an acceptable match. When
            a potential match is identified, all tickets in the proposed match are advanced to
            the next status. 
            </para>
             </li> <li> 
            <para>
            If the match requires player acceptance (set in the matchmaking configuration), the
            tickets move into status <code>REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE</code>. This status triggers your
            client code to solicit acceptance from all players in every ticket involved in the
            match, and then call <a>AcceptMatch</a> for each player. If any player rejects or
            fails to accept the match before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped
            (see <code>AcceptMatch</code> for more details).
            </para>
             </li> <li> 
            <para>
            Once a match is proposed and accepted, the matchmaking tickets move into status <code>PLACING</code>.
            FlexMatch locates resources for a new game session using the game session queue (set
            in the matchmaking configuration) and creates the game session based on the match
            data.

            <para>
            When the match is successfully placed, the matchmaking tickets move into <code>COMPLETED</code>
            status. Connection information (including game session endpoint and player session)
            is added to the matchmaking tickets. Matched players can use the connection information
            to join the game.
